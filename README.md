# Youtube-downloader-Converter
Simple terminal script that replaces websites like y2mate etc, by downloading either mp3/mp4 directly to a specified output directory.


This program was made as a part of my python studies and is not complete nor made for an end user, 

this just worked well enough for what i wanted it to do for personal use! :)
